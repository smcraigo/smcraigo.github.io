### Java Programming Projects, Spring 2020

- [Programming Assignment #1](https://github.com/smcraigo/JavaProgramsSpring2020/blob/master/CraigoPass1.java)
 : I had to write a program to print on separate lines: my name, department name, course number and time for each course that I am taking this semester.  Additionally, I had to skip two lines and then provide my email address.
- [Programming Assignment #2](https://github.com/smcraigo/JavaProgramsSpring2020/blob/master/CraigoPass2.java) : I had to write a program that would calculate the number of center in a specific number of quarters, nickels & dimes.  The program does the following tasks: - Asks the user to enter the number of quarters, nickels and dimes. - Calculates the number of cents. - Displays to the monitor the number of quarter, nickels and dimes. - Display to the monitor the number of cents.
